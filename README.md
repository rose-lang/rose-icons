# Icons for the Rose Programming Language #

Because I have excellent priorities, this is the first thing I bothered to do.
The original rose icon is via [Elise Spinello](https://thenounproject.com/elisev/) and
was found via [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/rose/49365/). I modified its
shape a bit, and colorized it to make it what it is today. Like the original, this icon is
